# Graphics3D
Graphics3D not only has 3D graphics, but also massivly improves the speed and performance of graphics in general. The project has been under development for several months with many improvements and advancements made. The project is still under development and will stay so many years untill the performance has peaked.

## Raytracer
The project also includes a raytracer that is far from being done. The main focus now is to get it to run of the GPU for massive improvements in speed
